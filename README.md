# Hi there!

👋 My name is Matt. I am a Computer Science student at the University of Guelph graduating in Spring 2024. This is the hub of my little technological creations and passion projects.

🏫 Through my time at University, I've previously interned twice at Google, twice at Microsoft, Cisco, and for a distributed computing company called Distributive.

📚 I have also partaken in and enjoyed doing academic research! I have worked on a humanitarian research project funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under Professor Deborah Stacey called the [Global Burden of Animal Disease](https://animalhealthmetrics.org/). 

🧮 In addition to this, I researched algorithms related to de Bruijn Sequences, Necklaces, Lyndon words with Professor Joseph Sawada where I wrote an original algorithm that generates largest fixed-content Necklaces in polynomial time and wrote an [undergraduate thesis](https://github.com/Matt-Ng/Largest-Fixed-Content-Necklace/blob/main/Matthew_Ng_Fixed_Content_Necklaces.pdf) on it.

🕺 In my free time, I enjoy drawing, art, learning languages, and singing!
